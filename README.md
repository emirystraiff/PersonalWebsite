<h1 align="center"> My personal website</h1>

This is my first coding project learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although it is a BLAST learning every step of the way, my code is not as neat as I would like it to be. I plan to clean up the code later, but for now, I have included previews of the home pages below.
For this project, I wanted to combine two interests of mine that is very important to me: art and programming. Thus, I decided to create my personal portfolio website with an art side and a coding portfolio side.

### Features to add in future:
  - index.html:
    - This will be a "transition" page to either enter the art site or the coding site. I plan to add a simple but cool animation to transition to either page.  
    - possibly draw an animation of myself drawing and coding
  - Art side:
    - ecommerce/shop page where I could sell my digital art products
    - a "learn" page where I link amazing resources that has helped me improve my art, as well as making my own tutorials in the future.
    - a larger art gallery
    - an "about me" page
    - draw small drawing assets to decorate the pages
  - CS side:
    - finish building a one page scrollable resume pages with buttons that scroll to each section
    - Scroll-Activated Sticky Navigation
    - page scroll progress bar
    - a "learn" page where I link amazing resources that has helped me in my programming journey
